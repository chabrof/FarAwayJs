# Introduction

With FarAwayJs,  you can easily make NodeJs server distant calls :  
you use simple local functions or objects, which return Promises.

FarAwayJs gives to browsers a very simple way to communicate with a NodeJs server.

It's a kind of RPC for JS/TS functions/objects using WebSockets \(or, later, HTTP standard calls\).  
FarAwayJs is not intended to replace a REST API, it can, but this is not its primary goal \(see [What about a REST API ? ](/what-about-a-rest-api.md)for details\)
