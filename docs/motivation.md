# Motivation

As developers, we want to execute code on different modules, regardless of where it is located. We do not want to use special library or API calls because the code we want to run is on a foreign server. We want to access functions, objects as if there were directly available. HTTP, WebSocket layers must be totally transparent.

Javascript \(or Typescript\) is intended to be a unified language on the different parts of our architecture and we do our best to enjoy it.
